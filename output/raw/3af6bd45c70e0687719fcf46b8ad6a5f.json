  "raw_text": "# HOUSING ELEMENT APPROVAL STATUS - CERTIFIED!\n\nThe City Council adopted the 2021-2029 Housing Element on November 15, 2022. On January 17, 2023, after the City made some minor technical changes to the Housing Element, HCD issued a conditional approval letter which delayed full certification of the Housing Element until the City completed the rezoning described in Program 6 (Provision of Adequate Sites). The required rezoning was completed on May 7, 2024 and, thus, the California Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) issued a letter officially certifying the City's 2021-2029 Housing Element on July 15th. The final version of the Housing Element can be viewed here.\n\n## HOUSING ELEMENT IMPLEMENTATION STATUS\n\nCity staff is currently working on implementation of the required zone changes and other Housing Element programs.\n\n- **Housing Element Annual Progress Report**. On March 4, 2025, City staff will present the 2024 Housing Element Annual Progress Report (APR) which details the status of all the Housing Element programs. The Housing Element APR is part of the City's 2024 General Plan Progress Report that is submitted to the State annually. The staff report and 2024 Housing Element APR can be viewed on the Agendas and Minutes page of the City website.\n\n## AFFORDABLE HOUSING STRATEGY STATUS\n\nOne of the priorities in the Housing Element implementation process, is to prepare a comprehensive Affordable Housing Strategic Plan to supplement and build upon the Housing Element and help the City meet its future housing goals. A draft strategy was presented to Council on June 23, 2022. A revised Strategic Plan was presented to Council and adopted on December 19, 2023. As of July 15, 2024, the City has entered into a contract with a consulting firm RSG, Inc. to assist with implementation of the Strategic Plan.\n\n## Feedback\n\nShare your feedback regarding the Housing Element or the Affordable Housing Strategy with Principal Planner, Paul Samaras at psamaras@elsegundo.org.\n\n## Sign Up for Updates\n\n[Click to subscribe](https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/CAELSEGUNDO/subscriber/new?topic_id=CAELSEGUNDO_204)\n\n## Future Events\n\n**March 4, 2025 - City Council meeting**\n\nOn March 4, 2025, the City Council will consider the 2024 Housing Element Annual Progress Report (APR) which details the status of all the Housing Element programs.

The Housing Element identifies the City's housing needs and conditions, and establishes goals, objectives and policies that form the basis of the City's vision and strategy for enhancing and preserving the community's character, and expanding housing opportunities for all El Segundo's community members.\n\nAccording to State law, the Housing Element must:\n- Provide goals, policies, quantified objectives and scheduled programs to preserve, improve and develop housing\n- Identify and analyze existing and projected housing needs for all economic segments of the community\n- Identify adequate sites that are zoned and available within the 8-year housing cycle to meet the city's fair share of regional housing needs at all income levels\n- Be certified (approved) by the State Department of Housing and Community Development (HCD) as complying with state law\n- Be internally consistent with other parts of the General Plan\n\n## WHAT IS A REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS ASSESSMENT (RHNA)?\n\nThe Regional Housing Needs Assessment (RHNA) is mandated by State law to quantify the need for housing throughout the State. El Segundo has been provided a final RHNA allocation for 492 units to accommodate an estimated growth need at various income levels:\n\n| El Segundo 6th Cycle RHNA | UNITS |\n|---------------------------|-------|\n| Very low income (<50% AMI) | 189 |\n| Low income (50-80% AMI) | 88 |\n| Moderate income (80-120% AMI) | 84 |\n| Above Moderate Income (>120% AMI) | 131 |\n| Total | 492 |\n\n## Contact Information\n\nFor more information or questions about the Housing Element Update and the City's Affordable Housing Strategy, please call Paul Samaras, Principal Planner, at psamaras@elsegundo.org and (310) 524-2340",
