In California, cities and counties are required by State law to have a General Plan. Generally, cities comprehensively update their general plans every 15 to 20 years.\n\nA general plan is more than just a policy document - it reflects the vision, values, and priorities of a community. It defines what is unique and special that should be preserved and identifies strategic ways to improve a city's quality of life. Because a general plan impacts so many members of the community - residents, visitors, business owners, and more - the process of updating a general plan is a unique opportunity to come together as a community to develop a shared vision for the future.\n\n**What is a General Plan Land Use Element?**\n\nA General Plan Land Use Element is the long-term blueprint for the physical development of the City in both narrative and graphic terms. It contains broad goals, objectives, policies and programs, as well as more specific development criteria and standards, such as a map with the allowed distribution of land uses and a listing of maximum limits for building heights and development density.\n\n## Why Update the General Plan Land Use Element?\n\nThe General Plan Land Use Element was last comprehensively updated when the overall General Plan was adopted in 1992.\n\nThe adopted Land Use Element had a time horizon of 15-20 years. However, over thirty years have passed since 1992 and most of the existing conditions at the time have changed significantly.\n\nAs a result, this year, the City initiated an effort to consult with the community and establish a new, enhanced vision.\n\n## Important Documents\n\n- [General Plan Land Use Element (Current)](https://www.elsegundo.org/home/showpublisheddocument/10718/638811851712930000)",
