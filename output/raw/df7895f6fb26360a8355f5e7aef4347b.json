It is a statement of policy, with text and diagrams, that is used as a tool for helping decision makers make decisions that are consistent with community goals. The state planning code of California requires every city and county to adopt a general plan. The government code also requires the plan to be an integrated, internally consistent document in which policies do not conflict with each other.\n\nThere are seven elements that are required by state law to be contained in every general plan: Land Use, Noise, Circulation, Housing, Open Space, Conservation, and Safety. Optional elements may also be included to address topics of local interest which relate to the physical development of the community, such as Air Quality and Economic Development.\n\nThe general plan is comprehensive in nature and content. It covers the entire geographic area that is located within the city limits, and it addresses a broad range of issues relating to the physical, economic, and social development of the community.\n\n### Overview of the City\nThe City of El Segundo is located in the Los Angeles urban area. It is considered part of the Airport/South Bay subregion at the southwestern edge of the Los Angeles coastal basin. Downtown Los Angeles is about 20 freeway miles from El Segundo.\n\nThe City itself is 5.46 square miles (3,494.4 acres), with a resident population, per the 1990 Census, of 15,223 people and a considerably larger daytime (employee) population of approximately 80,000.\n\nTo the north is Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) in the City of Los Angeles. To the east is Del Aire, which is an island of Los Angeles County, as well as the City of Hawthorne. The City of Manhattan Beach is directly south of El Segundo. To the west of El Segundo is the Pacific Ocean.\n\n## City Facilities\n1. Recreation Park\n2. Library Park\n3. Hilltop Park\n4. Acacia Park\n5. Washington Park\n6. Candy Cane Park\n7.
